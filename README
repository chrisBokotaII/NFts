# Rare NFT Marketplace

This is a project for a rare NFT marketplace built using Solidity, Hardhat, and React.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. Run the development servers by running `npm run dev` in the `frontend`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/collections` to view the marketplace.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

- The `frontend` directory contains the React frontend of the marketplace.
- The `backend` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts and the Hardhat development environment.

## Smart Contracts

The project includes two smart contracts: `Market.sol` and `Lock.sol`.

- `Market.sol` is the main contract that allows users to create, buy, and list NFTs.
- `Lock.sol` is a contract that allows users to mint their NFTS then list them for sale.

## Tests

The project includes tests for the smart contracts. You can run the tests by running `npx hardhat test` in the `backend` directory.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on the Rinkeby test network. You can view the deployed contracts and interact with them on the Rinkeby Etherscan.
